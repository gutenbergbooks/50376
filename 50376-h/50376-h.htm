<h3>SHEET LIGHTNING</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ig"><span class="letra">W</span>HEN on the green the rag-tag game had stopt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And red the lights through alehouse curtains glowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clambering brake drove out and took the road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the stern moors all the babble dropt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among those merry men, who felt the dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet to the soul and saw the southern blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thronged with heat lightning leagues and leagues abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working and whickering; snake-like; winged and clawed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or like old carp lazily rising and shouldering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long the slate cloud flank shook with the death-white smouldering;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not a voice.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">The night drooped oven-hot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then where the turnpike pierced the black wood plot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tongues wagged again and each man felt the grim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destiny of the hour speaking through him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then tales came of dwarfs on Starling Hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those young swimmers drowned at the roller mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where on the drowsiest noon the undertow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famishing for life boiled like a pot below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how two higglers at the “Walnut Tree”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had curst the Lord in thunderstorm and He<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had struck them into soot with lightning then&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It left the pitchers whole, it killed the men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a lad and many a lass was named<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who once stept bold and proud&mdash;but death had tamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their revel on the eve of May: cut short<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The primrosing and promise of good sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut up the score book, laid the ribbands by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such bodings mustered from the fevered sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the spring well through the honeycomb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scored stone rumbling tokened them near home,<a name="page_2" id="page_2"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whip lash clacked, the jog-trot sharpened, all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang “Farmer’s Boy” as loud as they could bawl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at the “Walnut Tree” the homeward brake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stopt for hoarse ribaldry to brag and slake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The weary wildfire faded from the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While this one damned the parson, that the clerk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anger’s balefire forked from the unbared blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At word of notches missed or stakes not paid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Joe the driver stooped with oath to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A young jack rabbit in the roadway, blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dazzled by the lamps, as stiff as steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fear. Joe beat its brain out on the wheel.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And here their hatchet cleared the glade:<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Sat to take their beer and bread:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In the old brown Bible scrawled,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Whom the city never called;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce could read or hold a quill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built the barn, the forge, the mill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the green they watched their sons<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Playing till too dark to see,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As my father once watched me;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While thoughts, such as you guess, are often here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing a sweet temptation.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I have gone forth at midnight with no robe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Neither the blade of sharp-projecting flint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wind nor rain nor burning tongue of flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knotted scourge can leave a mark on me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These lips are no less red since they were kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By glowing coal; these hands are yet untorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is my fate, with flesh insensible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To suffer from a mind which has no love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no distraction. Have it as you will,<br /></span>

<h3>LIFE AND LUXURY</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ig"><span class="letra">I</span> HELD imagination’s candle high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thread the pitchy cavern, life. A whisper<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dazed all the dark with sweetness oversweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lithe body languished around my neck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Do out this unavailing light;” she pleaded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Soother is darkness. How may candle strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With topless, bleak, obdurate blanks of space?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It can but cold the darkness else were warm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave, leave to search so bitter-toilfully<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unthroughgone silence, leave and follow me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I will lead where many riches lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where rippling silks and snow-soft cushions, rare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cool wines, and delicates unearthly sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the comfort flesh of man craves more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We two shall dallying uncurl the long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fragrant hours.” She reached a slender arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly along mine to the light. I flung her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off, down. My candle showed her cheeks raddled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bindweed pressure made me sick and mad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I flung her back to the gloom. Her further hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clanked; hidden gyves fell ringing to the rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peering behind her barely I could discern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outstretching bodies clamped along the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoving most and silent, some uneasy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirring and moaning. Smothery clutches came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of slothful scents and fingered at my throat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, brushing by them, unaccompanied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I held aloft my rushlight in the cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And searched for beauty through the cleaner air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus far in parable. Laugh loud, O world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laugh loud and hollow. There are those would spurn<a name="page_40" id="page_40"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your joys unjoyous and your acid fruits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would not tread the corpsy paths of commerce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor juggle with men’s bones; they would not chaffer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their souls for strumpet pleasure. Cast them out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deny what little they would ask of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assail, starve, torture, murder them, and laugh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall it be war between us? Better war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than faint submission&mdash;better death. And yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would not, no, nor shall not die. How weaponed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I go passionate against your host?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How, cautelous, elude your calm blockade?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of older days heart-free the poet roved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the furrowed lanes, and watched the robin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Squat in a puddle, whir his stumpy wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tweet amid the tempest he aroused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hare would hirple on ahead (keep back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her get out of sight; quick, cross yourself),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or taper weasel slink past over the road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, seeing native blossoms, breathing air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From English hills, what recked the wanderer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That barons threw no penny to his song?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should he be hungered, he would seek some rill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, scrambling down the hazel scarp, would walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wet-ankled up the stream until he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A larger pool of cold, colourless water,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full two-foot deep, scooped out of solid stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a chuckling trickle spated after rains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he would rest upon the bank, while slowly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fingers crept along the crannied rock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor starveling belly!&mdash;No, that lower fissure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight, lipless grin like an unholy god’s,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reach out for that. The water stings to his armpit,<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations

status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
